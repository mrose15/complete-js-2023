<!--
  Notes: 
  - major shift to declarative and functional programing
Two diff ways of writting codes (paradigms)
- imperative
  - programmer explains how to do things
  - " explains every step is has to follow to achieve a result
  const arr = [2,4,6,8];
  const doubled = [];
  for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i++)
    doubled[i] = arr[i] * 2;
- declarative
  - programmer tells the computer "what to do"
  - we describe the way the computer should achieve the result
  - the how (step-by-step) gets abstracted away
  const arr = [2,4,6,8];
  const doubled = arr.map(n => n * 2);
These can be mixed  

Sub paradigm of the declarative paradigm called functional programming
- based on the idea of writing software by combining many pure functions, avoiding side effects and mutating data
- side effect - a modification (mutation) of any data outside of the function (mutating external variables), logging to the console, writing to DOM, etc)
- pure function - function w/o side effects, does not depend on external variable. give the same inputs, always returns the same outputs.
- we avoid mutating data by using immutability, original state (data) is never modified. instead, state is copied and the copy it mutated and returned. 
- React/Redux are built on these principles. State is immutable in React 

function programming techniques: 
 - try to avoid data mutations
 - use built in methods that don't produce side effects
 - do data transofrmations with methods such as map , filter and reduce ( present in all functional programming languages )
 - try to avoid side effects in functions, not always possible

 declarative syntax: 
 - use array and object descructuring as much as possible
 - use the spread operator (...)
 - use the ternary operator
 - use template literals
