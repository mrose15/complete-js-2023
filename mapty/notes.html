231. Project planning
- Start with user stories - descript of application's functionality from the user's perspective. All user stories put togther describe the entire app.
- features
- flowchart - what we'll build
- architecture - how we will built it
- dev step - implementation of our plan in code

user stories: 
common format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]"
who/what/why

1) As a user I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps/min, so I can keep a log of all my running
  -> map, geolocation, form

2) As a user I want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain, so I can keep a log of all my cycling
-> form

3) As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time
-> display list

4) As a user, I want to see my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I workout the most
-> display on map

5) As a user, I want to see all my workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so I can keep using the app over time
-> store data in the browser using local storage API
-> on page load, read the saved data from local storage and display
