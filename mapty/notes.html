231. Project planning
- Start with user stories - descript of application's functionality from the user's perspective. All user stories put togther describe the entire app.
- features
- flowchart - what we'll build
- architecture - how we will built it
- dev step - implementation of our plan in code

user stories: 
common format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]"
who/what/why

1) As a user I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps/min, so I can keep a log of all my running
  -> map, geolocation, form

2) As a user I want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain, so I can keep a log of all my cycling
-> form

3) As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time
-> display list

4) As a user, I want to see my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I workout the most
-> display on map

5) As a user, I want to see all my workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so I can keep using the app over time
-> store data in the browser using local storage API
-> on page load, read the saved data from local storage and display

236. Project architecture
classes and objects
- Where/How do we store the data?
  -- Comes from user stories:  running: location, distance, time, pace, steps/minute (candence)) and cycling: location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain
  -- one parent Workout class, two child class (Running and Cycling) that will inherit from Workout
- Need to structure code: load page, receive position, click on mal, change input, submit form
  -- create big class called App that will hold all functions as methods
